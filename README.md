# Multimodal
I will be working on the Kaggle project, to explore multimodal models.
The dataset contains:
1. tabular data on the demographics and physical activity
2. time series data accelerometer sensor values

I will wrangle the data to treat the missing values and handle categories and outliers.
The train.csv has 82 columns and 2960 records
